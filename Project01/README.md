I did the 5.1 and 5.6. For 5.1, I used the if statement ang give 
it a parameter to connect it with other function. Then I use the 
if statement to do the 5.6. First I used the hint given in 5.6 to find 
untracked files. Then I ckeck all the files with .tmp,if I find any of 
these files, used rm to remove them.
